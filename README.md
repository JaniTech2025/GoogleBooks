# BookNest â€“ Google Books API based Search App

A simple React app built with **Vite** that allows users to search for books by title using the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books). It features input validation, responsive UI, and detailed book modals. In the UI design, the font, style and colours have been chosen to be mild, calming and have a book reading corner effect.

/\*\*

- Truncates a description to a preview of the first 15 words.
- @param {string} description - The full text description (can be empty).
- @returns {Object} An object containing either the original or a truncated preview description.
  \*/

const words = description.split(/\s+/);

// Join the first 15 words back into a string
const previewWords = words.slice(0, 15).join(" ");

## What I learnt

- How to handle fetch and display data from an external API

- Handling boundary cases for input from user

- Using modals to show context-based additional information,
  in this case it is displaying information pertaining to a book when user clicks on the book card.

- Displaying fallback UI for missing or empty data, to ensure application doesn't break on external data fetch errors

## Install instructions

- git clone https://git@github.com:JaniTech2025/GoogleBooks.git
